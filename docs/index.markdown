#### Hi everyone! This is the beginning of my GitPage! Through the semester I hope to work on an develop this page in order to make it a proper website for hosting all of my work! I have the following goals for this Site:

1.	~~Add a Blog System in order to better display my work (Utilize Jekyll)~~ **DONE**
2. Add a Comment System in order to receive feedback on pages (Utterances)
3. Develop more systems & pages for better navigation
4. Add Projects I’ve worked on in the past as a part of a portfolio
5. Utilize Bootstrap to clean up the site and make it look nicer

#### There’s still a long way to go, so please bear with me while the Site is worked on!
##### For the time being see below for my current work for the Class:
