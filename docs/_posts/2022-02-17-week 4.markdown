This Week I worked on getting my site working with Jekyll!

This is a complicated process, so I will be posting a tutorial on how I setup and use Jekyll for my own site in the near future.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight java %}
System.out.println("Hello World");
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}

Check out the [Jekyll docs][jekyll-docs] for more info on Jekyll!.
