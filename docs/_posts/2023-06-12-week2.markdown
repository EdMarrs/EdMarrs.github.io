###The Simple Things a Data Science Beginner Needs to Know

I found this article interesting to read as someone somewhat new but also somewhat familiar to data collection and data science. Specifically I found the parts about automation and machine learning algorithms most intersting. I also liked reading about the specific categories of data collection that data can fall into with supervised and unsupervised learning. I beleive that both of them serve very good specific purposes when collecting and utilizing data. Overall, it was a very interesting article to read.

### Python:

A Majority of the Python I already had done in my previous work last week, so I skipped around a bit, and focused more heavily on R which I have less experience with.

### R:
For R, I used the following file [here][code].

It started off relatively simple, but started getting very complicated towards the end and some of the questions weren't very clear, so I did my own outside research to assist in answering the questions.
