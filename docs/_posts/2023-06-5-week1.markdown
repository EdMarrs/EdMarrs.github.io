# Introduction to Python Charts and R

### Python:
Link to Kaggle Notebook:

### R:

For R, I had a bit of background knowlege but used a couple of online tutorials in order to help myself out.

I began with some basic commands:
```
> 5+5
[1] 10
> 5
[1] 5
> "Hello World"
[1] "Hello World"
> print("Hello World!")
[1] "Hello World!"
> for (x in 1:10) {
+     print(x)
+ }
[1] 1
[1] 2
[1] 3
[1] 4
[1] 5
[1] 6
[1] 7
[1] 8
[1] 9
[1] 10
> value1 <- 1
> value2 <- "hello"
> value2
[1] "hello"
> paste(value1,value2)
[1] "1 hello"
```

These let me asses and get used to the environment of R.

From there I looked into graphing. I created a sample of data to make a line graph plotting grades against absences:
```
grades <- c(10,40,50,100,95,30,80,85,65,90)
> abs <- c(5,4,2,1,0,8,1,0,3,0)
> plot(grades,abs)
> plot(abs,grades)
> plot(abs,grades, cex=19)
> plot(abs,grades, pch=19)
> plot(abs,grades, pch=19, type='l')
> sort(grades)
 [1]  10  30  40  50  65  80  85  90  95 100
> sort(abs)
 [1] 0 0 0 1 1 2 3 4 5 8
> plot(abs,grades, pch=19, type='l')
```

From there, I wanted to try plotting and counting the amount of students who had a certain amount of absences, and putting them into a chart. > totals = rle(sort(abs))
I used the rle command to get a count of how many time each value appeared in the vector.

```
> totals = rle(sort(abs))
```

From there, I was able to generate the pie graph to show the data.
```
> pie(totals$lengths, labels=totals$values, main = "Student Absences")
```
Overall, R is a very helpful tool for generating quick graphs and looking at data.
